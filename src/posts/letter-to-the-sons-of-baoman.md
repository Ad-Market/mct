# Dear Sons of Baoman

50k was dropped to about 13 wallets. All members of the SOB Twitter DM group. 

That's you.

I did this becuase I felt you'd "get it". As in, wouldn't dump on me. I was right. And you're smart people who have helped me learn as we've built this out. I did pass out silly amounts as I pointed out to Elon the other day. He concurred. Very silly amounts. 

Anyway. 

50k  dropped to 13 SOB's wallets

This is 650,000 PUPPR. 

That's 6.5% of the total supply (.5 million burned not factored in)

Also, 1k was dropped to aprox. 50 wallets. Some of you got these also. The others belong to what we assume are strong hands. This happened in the Discord server Kennedy put up. 

Now were at 700,000 PUPPR

To round up to an even 1 Million, other airdrops went to TOSA wallets (all those many sums of 50), FRENCORP (the PUPPR art department), a handful of EGG holders (like barely any), the Twitter airdrop, and variety of other folks. 

So that's where 1 million are.

Now. 3 million.

1 SOBS and above-mentioned

1 Baldwin Capital

1 split between Devs and LPs


That's 3 million.

Roughly 7 million remain in the treasury.

You can see the lions' share of 3 million "circulating supply" is in the hands of you/us in the SOB chat.  

#### WTF

Now, begining to chip away at the treasury supply we are setting up offers for OTC buyers and LPs. 

We would hope that you would look at those to get an idea of your position.

Example: We are selling up to 1% of the supply at half the market value. 100,000 PUPPR = 2500 USD at present. Funds go into liquidity. Clearly we need that. 

You with each 50k have .5% of the supply. Holy shit.

If we get to a dollar you see what the problem will be. Who will pay you 50,000 USD for your PUPPR then? Not that you would sell of course. 

I realise I didn't disribute to more pool jocky's as I should have. We're mostly all retail type buy/sell bros. Consider playing the pools instead of the token itself. Consider passing off some of your supply to a pool jockey you know who knows what to do. 

Your 50k is just bits and bytes unless you do something with it. From our perspective we want to give it away to people who will make the market. You can do that on a smaller scale. 

PUPPR will be a dollar on the charts. It will probable "test" it multiple times and fall progressively less. We're gonna keep adding air to it and fingers crossed we get a sooner-than-later, out-of-left-field, influx of outside buyers when it's performing a moon mission. We get a few more genuine wallets each time it pamps. 

My dudes

1. Send some back to the Treasury

2. Keep. Diamond hands BTFO my PUPPR you evil market manipulators

3. Distro to a pool jockey or e-celeb who will pamp your bags. (some of you have already done this)

4. Put up LP with a portion and stake the rest in puppr-staking (not a lp token pool)

5. Other. What say you?

6. I'm not going to say what 6 is. Don't do this one though.

   
   Thanks guys
