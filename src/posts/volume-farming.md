Ethan, 


I had bought the puppr.country domain name intending it to be for the "farming" website.

We have **$puppr** now. Check.

Make $cntry (Country) 

Nice name for a farm if you ask me. "Headed out to Puppr Country folks."  We might not need any more xSwap names by now anyway.


### $CNTRY

Fork Statera.sol to Country.sol https://github.com/StateraProject/statera-token/blob/master/contracts/Statera.sol

Make BSC compatible/optimized


Mimicing Statera's offerings. Something like:



#### DUAL ASSET POOLS

PUPPR/CNTRY

PUPPR/ETH

PUPPER/BAO

PUPPR/PANDA

Community generated pools



#### MULTI-ASSET POOLS

PUPPR/COUNTRY/BAO

PUPPR/COUNTRY/PANDA

PUPPR, BAO, PANDA

PUPPR, ETH, BTC, BAO, LINK (Blue Chip)

Community generated pools



**To quote Statera**: "When an asset's ratio increases relative to the others, the portfolio will rebalance itself by selling the token that has gained value.

This is accomplished by utilizing arbitrage opportunities in the external markets for the imbalanced tokens. Anyone can participate in the arbitrage by providing liquidity."
