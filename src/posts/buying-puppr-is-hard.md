It's confusing for many. 

Can we find a **a CEX** that can support our token? Maybe with a stable coin pairing? Maybe too soon?

This route to buying is better know to many. Example: Go to Kucoin. Buy Puppr. Do our LP providers prefer we remain focused soley on DEX / Pancake? Might not want to draw attention away from our pools on Pancake.

**So now, with DEX** (PancakeSwap etc..), converting tokens and bridging can only have as few steps as is possible. Should provide concise and step-reduced instructions for all the common routes:

- Binance users instructions
- Coinbase users instructions
- Uniswap users instructions
- Instructions for other large user bases

As is we say, PUPPR is trading on PancakeSwap. BUSD/PUPPR  and BNB/PUPPR pairs and provide links to each with the PUPPR and BUSD fields pre-populated in the swapping interface Pancake provides.

Our docs cover some of these steps but should clarify where we can and be sure to address each user base as listed above.
