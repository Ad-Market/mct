Dear Shitlords,

This is not the token of Antifa, the Alt-right, the Masons, Shriners, or Janet's quilting group.

Sperging out about politics can be done elswhere. If you are upset about Allysa Milano or Jack Prosiec's opinion about x, y, or z, you can vent about that somewhere else. Either reddit or /pol/ depending on your conditioning. 

We can't control whatever organic flowering bursts forth from the bowels of the puppr holding meme-lords online. We won't try to manufacture a vibe so by all means make Puppr yours. But, If you do anything childish, rude, or counter-productive we will say goodbye.

We reserve the right to point out bad behavior and act on it regardless of your perceptions. 

I will edit this COC to have a more friendly tone when I am in a calmer mood. 


ðŸ’…
