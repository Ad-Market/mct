*Rough draft. Please take a moment to read this.Thanks!*


## Puppr contract on BSC

https://thefranswan.gitbook.io/puppr/puppertoken.sol


## Puppr. What it can do?

### Staking to earn $PUPPR 

A basic feature. 2% of every $PUPPR traded or transferred is distributed to those who have staked on the dapp. (Connection issues with the app as MetaMask intigration not up to par) Will work however if using technique in Docs.  

- If you send 500 $PUPPR to a friend or another wallet, 10 is taken away to a reward "pool".
- If you buy 500 puppr you are only getting 480.

*Still testing to confim that the reward calculations are based on percentage of shared pool stake.* 





## What Puppr holders can expect going forward



### "Deflation" 

A deflationary pattern of some kind. Perhaps needs to be a manual burn --Becuase the contract is already deployed without that baked in. A schedule would have to be made and the number to be "burned" decided. ("Burn" by sending to un unrecoverable wallet or something guaranteeing they are gone forever).

### Dog rescue as "deflation"

Another possibility, **send a sum of token desired to be "burned" to stagnating wallets:** "Airdrop" to holders of other token projects that are **near dead**. If they are dog tokens it wil be known as a dog rescue.

How these dog resuce drops simulate a deflationary affect: In the first several days following the drop, It will be largely unclaimed $puppr as many holders will not be aware of the drop. Those who learn about the drop over time will trickle in in such a way as to ease the pressure that would otherwise come from a sudden flood of "this will pay my cell phone bill" dumpers. The tokens that are never acknowledged by other holders (unbeknownst to them), will dissapear into the ether :)

Obvioulsy this it not truly a reduction of circulating supply, but it would have a similar affect on price I'm assuming . Statistics from data services will not reflect the importance of this affect in market cap for example but does that matter? Trading volume would be our claim to greatness.

## $wags 

A new contract. Doing more than we can with $puppr. Could make another pancakeswap clone and offer $wags pairings with other dog and animal tokens on BSC. This could be PupprSwap 

Extremely hesitant to announce such a think on a roadmap as I'm not ready for that workload. It's a future maybe that's for sure. 

## Thanks!
